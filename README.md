# Classification-with-NeuralNetwork

Our goal in this project is to write code that can predict 10 different monkey species. 
We wrote the Multilayer Neural Network class ourselves in the code, and we used CNN from 
ready-made libraries. We tried to see the effect of the parameters on the model by testing 
the model with different parameters of the neural network.
